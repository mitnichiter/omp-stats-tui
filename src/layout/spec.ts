/**
 * THE LAYOUT IR — an intermediate representation of the web dashboard.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The three hand-written screens each invented their own visual structure.
 * Overview opens with a stat strip, a token list, a bar chart and a model
 * ranking; Activity opens with a calendar; Models opens with a model ranking
 * and then per-model blocks. Nothing connects them. The panel reads as three
 * unrelated text blocks rather than as one ported dashboard, and every new
 * screen has to invent a fourth grammar. That is not a styling bug — it is a
 * missing level of abstraction.
 *
 * So the visual structure moves down into DATA. A screen is a `ScreenSpec`: a
 * stack of bands, each naming the metrics it needs and how it is composed. A
 * renderer (a later task) turns bands into `pi-tui` components. Three things
 * follow, and they are the whole argument:
 *
 *   1. THE VISUAL GRAMMAR BECOMES A DATA DECISION. Adding a stat tile to a
 *      screen is adding an object to an array, not editing a `render`.
 *   2. THE THREE SCREENS ARE PROVABLY CONSISTENT, because there is one grammar
 *      and all three draw from it. Consistency stops being something a reviewer
 *      has to notice.
 *   3. A NEW SCREEN IS A DATA CHANGE, NOT A REWRITE.
 *
 * WHAT THE IR DELIBERATELY DOES NOT KNOW
 *
 * No glyphs, no colours, no widths, no presets. Those are renderer concerns, and
 * encoding them here would make the grammar a rendering policy a second screen
 * could quietly violate. A band that needs to say "this matters" says
 * `emphasis: "primary"`; how emphasis LOOKS is the renderer's problem, and
 * changing it must not mean editing ten screens. For the same reason there is no
 * `if (ascii)` here — and no width, because how a band behaves at 40 columns is
 * not a fact about the dashboard's structure. `test/layout-ir.test.ts` asserts
 * all of that against the serialised data rather than trusting this comment.
 *
 * METRIC REFERENCES
 *
 * A `MetricRef` names a VALUE and never says how that value reads:
 * `"$1,039.27 · 34,870 unpriced"` and `"112.36"` come from the same field.
 * Separating what is shown from how it is formatted is what lets one screen show
 * a cost as a headline and another show the same cost as a table cell without
 * either hard-coding the other's choice.
 *
 * Every import below is `import type`, which the test asserts. This module's
 * only runtime content is its own data, because an IR that can compute is an
 * IR that will eventually contain the rendering it was meant to describe.
 *
 * SOURCES
 *
 * Every spec cites the route file and line range it was ported from, so a later
 * agent can diff the port against the original instead of trusting it.

 * `DataNeed`, and `NEED_BY_SOURCE` is that map — it is the whole reason the IR

 *
 * The network-only windows payload has NO source: the panel never fetches
 * `/api/stats/provider-windows`, so the IR cannot name it either.
