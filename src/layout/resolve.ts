/**
 * `src/layout/resolve.ts` — an IR value, made real.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. `MetricRef` is a DECLARATION: it names a value and
 * says nothing about how the value reads. That separation is what lets one
 * screen show a cost as a headline and another show the same cost as a table
 * cell without either hard-coding the other's choice. But a declaration that
 * nothing fulfils is a comment, so this module is where the declaration meets
 * a `PanelData` and produces a number or a string.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING HERE: a value that cannot be resolved is
 * `null`, never `undefined`, never `NaN`, never `"undefined"`. An unresolvable
 * ref produces a BLANK CELL, and a blank cell is invisible — the screen still
 * renders, still looks plausible, and the reader never learns a figure is
 * missing. That is the failure this project has already paid for once (the
 * no-catalog-card model reading `$0.00` for $935 of real spend). So the return
 * type carries `null` explicitly, every arithmetic path guards its divisor, and
 * `test/resolve.test.ts` walks EVERY ref in EVERY spec against a fixture shaped
 * like the real route response. An unresolvable ref is a test failure naming
 * the screen and the path, not a blank cell a human has to notice.
 *
 * `NEED_BY_SOURCE` decides fetchability, and it is the IR's own table rather
 * than a second one here. `explainUnresolved` uses it to say WHICH of three
 * very different failures it is looking at:
 *
 *   1. `providerStats` — no need fills it (its route does network I/O). The
 *      screen is `deferred`, and a blank cell there is the honest answer.
 *   2. the need was never fetched — a WIRING bug. `fetchFor` never asked, so
 *      "no data" here means "not asked", which is not the same as "nothing
 *      happened" and must not be painted as an empty range.
 *   3. the need was fetched and the payload is empty — the real, honest zero.
 *
 * PURE. No I/O, no theme, no database, no clock. Everything here is a function
 * of `(MetricRef, PanelData)` plus an optional row scope, which is what makes it
 * testable without a terminal and without a 321 MB database.

 *
 * This is the ONLY path into a chart, which is what keeps charts honest: they
 * cannot invent a bucket, and a source with no rows yields `[]` rather than an
 * array of zeroes that would draw a flat "nothing happened" chart when the
 * truth is "nothing was fetched".
 *
 * `opts.axis` is what makes a value a POSITION. With it the series is DENSE:
 * one entry per bucket, gaps 0, the same length for every series so two
 * sparklines in one table line up column for column — which is what the web gets
 * from `pivotSeries`. Without it the series is the buckets that carry rows,
 * which is only safe for a caller drawing values positionally for something
 * other than time.
 *
 * The axis is passed in rather than derived here because deriving it needs the
 * range and the clock, and this module is pure. `screen.ts` builds it once from
 * the host's own `bucketAxis` and passes it down — ONE axis rule, not two that
 * agree today.
