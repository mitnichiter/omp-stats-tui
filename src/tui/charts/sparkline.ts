/**
 * The three thin chart primitives: sparkline, ranked bar list, share bar.
 *
 * Pure render functions. No I/O, no theme singleton, no database. Every mark
 * comes from the glyph module through `glyph()`, so the ASCII preset degrades
 * without this file knowing that a preset exists.
 *
 * ── Four rules, each one a rule against a specific lie ──────────────────────
 * F17 (Crush/btop/bottom/gnuplot/VisiData), F18 (ratatui) and F19 (glyph audit)
 * surveyed independently and converged on all four. They are not style choices:
 *
 * 1. **ZERO-BASELINED AGAINST A CALLER-SUPPLIED MAX. NEVER MIN-MAX.**
 *    Min-max stretches each series to fill the ramp, so a quiet week renders
 *    identically to a busy one — precisely backwards for a stats panel. Every
 *    function here takes an explicit `max` and scales against it.
 *    DO NOT "improve" this into min-max. Ratatui states the rule in as many
 *    words: "there is no min-max stretch, so a flat series renders as a solid
 *    row rather than as noise."
 *
 * 2. **`max === 0` IS A REAL CASE, NOT A CRASH.** A week with no activity must
 *    render as a zero-baseline run of glyphs. Crush's guard is `if (max === 0)
 *    max = 1`; we take the equivalent, and never return "" for a series that
 *    has data — an empty line inside a bordered panel reads as a layout bug.
 *
 * 3. **CLIP, DO NOT DOWNSAMPLE — AND KEEP THE NEWEST.** Averaging adjacent
 *    samples invents values that were never observed, which on a stats panel is
 *    a fabricated data point. Ratatui clips to the OLDEST `width` samples, which
 *    is wrong for a live panel because it hides today; we take the LAST `width`.
 *    (The one exception is cost, where SUMMING is the semantics — that is
 *    `densify`, used by `bars.ts`, not this file.)
 *
 * 4. **A ZERO-VALUED ROW MUST BE VISIBLE.** In a ranked list a zero row emits
 *    at least one cell, so it reads as "measured, and zero" rather than as
 *    "no data". Same reasoning as bars.ts: a not-yet-built bucket must never
 *    look like a cheap one.
 *
 * The cost of unpriced requests is handled by `costWithUnpriced` from
 * `../format`, which is the single implementation of that rule (Task 4). It is
 * reused, never re-derived here.
