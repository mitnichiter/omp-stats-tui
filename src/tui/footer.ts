/**
 * `src/tui/footer.ts` — the panel's key hints, hand-rolled for the ANSI path.
 *
 * WHY HAND-ROLLED. `hintsRow` returns a `NativeNode`, so it is unusable
 * anywhere but the native renderer (F20: `native/overlay.ts:42-51`). `/usage`
 * builds its own hint string and renders it as a single dim span
 * (`overlays/usage-dashboard.ts:926`: `this.#footer.setLines([theme.fg("dim", hint)])`),
 * joining the pieces with `" · "`. `/settings` does the same for its ANSI twin
 * (`overlays/settings-selector.ts:107-145`, `settingsHintsNode`). This module is
 * that same shape, built from `formatKeyHints` so every keycap matches the rest
 * of the host UI rather than being spelled by hand.
 *
 * ONE TONE, NOT TWO. The row is wrapped ONCE in `theme.fg("dim", …)`. The
 * earlier split — dim keys beside muted labels — was this module's own idea,
 * and it is now wrong twice over: it is not what `/usage` does, and a footer is
 * a chrome line, not content. A hint row that competes with the data above it
 * is a chrome line nobody reads. Keycaps and labels are therefore the same
 * weight, and the only thing that separates two hints is the separator.
 *
 * `[`/`]` is the screen switch outside text entry; Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N is available
 * during search. Controllers own Tab/Shift+Tab focus and contextual arrows.
 * The range uses `r`/`R` outside text entry, so search terms remain literal.
 *
 * WHY THE HINTS ARE DATA. A footer built by concatenating strings is a footer
 * that drifts from the keymap: a key gets rebound, the hint does not, and the
 * panel advertises something it no longer does. {@link hintsFor} returns the keys
 * as `KeyName`s, so a test can round-trip every one of them through
 * `panelAction` and fail when a hint names an unbound key.
 *
 * PURE. The hint SET is a function of state; the colouring comes from an
 * injected `Theme`, so the module holds no singleton and loads before theme
 * init. No terminal reads, no data access, no timers.

 *
 * `scrollable` puts the scroll hint FIRST rather than in the middle. F23 §3.2's
 * argument: it is the one hint whose absence changes what the reader can DO, so
 * it belongs where the eye lands, and a footer that buries it mid-row teaches the
 * reader to skip the footer.
 *
 * EVERY KEY HERE IS BOUND BY `panelAction`. That is not a convention, it is an

 * `panelAction` and fails if it returns null. A hint for an unbound key is a lie

/**
 * The footer row.
 *
 * ONE `dim` SPAN for the whole row, `/usage`-style. Hints are separated by a
 * `borderMuted` dot — one step quieter than the text it divides — and every
 * keycap renders through `formatKeyHints` so it looks like a keycap everywhere
 * else in the host.
 *
 * Hints are dropped WHOLE, never truncated. A hint that ends mid-word is worse
 * than a shorter footer, and `truncateToWidth` on a STYLED string can cut an
 * escape sequence in half and leak the remainder as literal text — which is why
 * the fit is measured on the assembled row with `visibleWidth` and the row is
 * rebuilt after each drop.
 *
 * THE LAST HINT IS PINNED. A plain "drop from the right" loop eats `close`
 * first, and `close` is the only exit from a fullscreen overlay that borrowed
 * the alt screen buffer: a user on a 60-column terminal would be told how to
 * scroll, switch screens, change range and sync, and never how to leave. So the
 * set is read as `head · middle… · tail`, where `head` is the scroll hint —
 * whose absence changes what the reader can DO, F23 §3.2's own argument for
 * putting it first — and `tail` is `close`. Both are load-bearing; the middle
 * hints (range, sync) are conveniences that degrade gracefully, and they are
 * the only things a narrow terminal gives up, in that order. If even
 * `head + tail` does not fit, `tail` alone does: showing how to leave beats
 * showing how to scroll.
 *
 * Returns `[]` rather than `undefined` for an empty hint set: a panel row is a
 * string, and `PanelRows` must never be handed nothing where a row is expected.
