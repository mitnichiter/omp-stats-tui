/**
 * The tab strip: the `Tab[]` the panel hands to `TabBar`, the one-cell `short`
 * table that keeps it on ONE row, and a `TabBarTheme` closed over OUR injected
 * `Theme` rather than the host singleton.
 *
 * WHY `short` IS A SEPARATE TABLE
 *
 * `TabBar` renders full labels and, only if they overflow, collapses the tabs
 * FURTHEST FROM THE ACTIVE ONE to `short`, then wraps (`tab-bar.ts:271-286`).
 * So `short` is not decoration — it is the budget that decides whether the strip
 * costs the body one row. Our `ScreenSpec.short` values are 6-8 cell words, and
 * `statsIcon` cannot stand in: the ascii arm of `STATS_ICONS` is VARIABLE
 * (`"tok:"` = 4 cells, `"[!!]"` = 4, `"cache"` = 5, `src/tui/icons.ts:106-124`),
 * and 12 tabs of 5 cells plus padding plus gutters is 108 columns. Hence
 * {@link TAB_SHORT}, which is one cell on all three presets and is asserted to
 * be by measurement in `test/tabs.test.ts`.
 *
 * WHY THE UNICODE ARM IS NOT `STATS_ICONS`
 *
 * Two cells is the rule for an ICON (`icons.ts:5-9`: an emoji is fine where the
 * heading reserves `ICON_GUTTER`). A tab cell has no gutter. Every emoji in the
 * unicode arm measures 2, so the strip would need 58 + 9 columns; one cell is
 * the only form that fits 80. Where a 1-cell form already exists in
 * `STATS_ICONS.unicode` (`trendUp`, `models`, `warning`) it is reused verbatim;
 * the rest are the geometric symbols that read as overview / calendar /
 * folder / chart / tools / host, and are asserted 1 cell by test rather than by
 * eye.
 *
 * WHY THE ACTIVE TAB IS A FILL AND A LUMINANCE STEP
 *
 * The strip is the panel's largest piece of chrome — at twelve tabs it is more
 * line than any band — so what it is NOT allowed to be is more body text. Ours
 * drew every inactive segment at `muted`, which put the strip at the same
 * strength as the nav labels beside it, and a strip that reads as content is
 * not a control.
 *
 * So this adapter mirrors `.segmented`, the web's own treatment of "a row of
 * options with one selected" (styles.css:1056-1102): every option is
 * `--ink-3` (:1083-1096), `:hover` is `--ink-1` (:1097-1099), and
 * `[data-active]` is `--ink-1` on the `--raised` thumb (:1100-1102, :1068-1080).
 * `selectedBg` is the terminal's stand-in for that thumb — a terminal has no
 * border-radius, so a filled background IS "an enclosed surface", which is the
 * same rule `.live-chip` obeys (styles.css:1595-1597).
 *
 * `hoverTab` deliberately takes NO fill. The active segment already owns the
 * band, so if hover took it too the two states would be told apart by bold
 * alone — which a theme that renders no bold cannot express. Instead hover is
 * ink-1 on no fill and active is ink-1 on the fill: one background, two inks,
 * and the distinction survives a monochrome theme.
 *
 * `label` is the bar's own LEADING LABEL, not a tab style — `TabBar` renders it
 * once, before the first tab (components/tab-bar.ts:191, :240-243), and the
 * panel passes an empty label. It is kept for host parity and is deliberately
 * NOT the accent: the accent is spent on the active row of the nav and the one
 * number a screen is about (css-tokens.md:104), not on a prefix we never draw.
