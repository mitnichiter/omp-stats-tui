/**
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 *
 * A chart should never lay itself out. If each of the five charts decided its own
 * column widths, a 40-column terminal would produce five different and mutually
 * inconsistent answers — bars sized for a different width than the sparkline
 * beside them, a table that wraps where the chart above it did not. The failure
 * is not a crash; it is a panel that looks wrong in a way nobody can name.
 *
 * So one pure function decides every width threshold and every degradation, and
 * every render function downstream reads the numbers from here. It is pure on
 * purpose: no theme singleton (undefined at extension load, and reading it here
 * would throw), no database, no terminal. That is what makes the degradation
 * rules testable at all.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not compose the frame. `OverlayPanel` already insets content two
 * columns on each side, draws the titled top border, the bottom border and the
 * section rules, and `PanelRows` already clips and pads a body region to an
 * exact height. Duplicating that arithmetic here is how the two drift apart, so
 * the insets below are the only ones and they mirror the panel's documented
 * behaviour. This module answers "which regions exist and how wide is each";
 * the chrome components answer "how are they drawn".
