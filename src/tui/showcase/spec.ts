/**
 * `src/tui/showcase/spec.ts` — the showcase's SECTIONS, declared as `ScreenSpec`s.
 *
 * The showcase does not hand-build a body. It declares sections in the same IR
 * the real screens use (`Band[]` on a `ScreenSpec`) and renders them through the
 * same `renderScreen` → `screenBands` → `renderBands` path, so what the playground
 * demonstrates is the GRAMMAR rather than a parallel renderer beside it. A
 * playground with its own string builder would prove nothing about the panel: it
 * would be a second implementation whose bugs are its own.
 *
 * Six sections, each answering one design question, and together covering every
 * grammar surface (`test/showcase-grammar.test.ts` holds that coverage):
 *
 *   - `tiles`   — stat tiles: emphasis, hints, sparklines, long and short labels.
 *   - `charts`  — every chart primitive, single- AND multi-series, every axis.
 *   - `tables`  — every cell kind, the column drop order, aligned figures.
 *   - `awkward` — a one-record table, a hundred-record one, a null latency, a
 *                 forty-cell label beside a twenty-character figure.
 *   - `states`  — measured zero against unmeasured, and a genuinely flat series.
 *   - `empty`   — the empty RANGE, as a whole-screen state.
 *
 * THE EMPTY RANGE IS WHOLE-SCREEN, and that is chart-redraw's ruling rather than a
 * shortcut: `chartBand` DROPS a band over a source that was never fetched, because
 * "nothing happened in this window" and "nobody asked" are different claims. So the
 * empty range gets its own section, and the "present but flat" case — a payload
 * that WAS fetched and returned all zeroes — is a genuinely third state shown
 * separately in `states`.
 *
 * WHAT THE SHOWCASE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DECLARE, per the owners of the modules
 * involved, so these are stated here rather than rediscovered as bugs:
 *
 *   - No `custom` band. `renderScreen`'s `toBand` turns every custom band into a
 *     NOTE, so it is the grammar's bypass rather than part of it, and it is being
 *     retired. A showcase that used it would demonstrate the bypass.
 *   - No `StatTile.size`. Dead by design: the panel picks tile columns from
 *     width, and a second size axis with no terminal effect would be a lie in the
 *     IR. `emphasis` is the only size lever that reaches the grammar.
 *   - No wrapped cell. Wrapping is out of the grammar by design — it breaks
 *     one-row-per-record, which every row-count invariant downstream depends on.
 *     The showcase shows TRUNCATION, and its note says so.
 *
 * WHY `needs` IS STILL DECLARED, on a showcase that fetches nothing. Because
 * `NEED_BY_SOURCE` is what makes a spec's declared needs and its refs agree, and
 * `test/showcase-fixtures.test.ts` asserts the two are consistent — a spec reading a
 * payload it never declared would render an empty band, and the showcase would be
 * exhibiting the panel's silent-empty trap as if it were design.
