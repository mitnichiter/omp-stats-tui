/**
 * `src/tui/showcase/panel.ts` — `/stats-test`'s overlay.
 *
 * THE MOUNT, not the design. The showcase's contribution is that it exercises the
 * panel's whole visual grammar on fabricated fixtures, and the fastest way to make
 * that a lie would be to hand-build its body — a second renderer whose bugs are its
 * own. So nothing here composes lines. Every body line comes out of `renderScreen`
 * on a declared `ScreenSpec` (`showcase/spec.ts`), and every frame region is the one
 * `panel.ts` uses.
 *
 * WHAT IS REUSED, and why each reuse is load-bearing:
 *
 *   - `panelAction` for the KEYMAP. It is a pure function from a key to a VERB and
 *     has no opinion about what a screen is, so the showcase consumes its verbs and
 *     resolves them against its own sections. That is why the `g`-prefix, the SGR
 *     wheel routing, the cancel keys and the digit row are not reimplemented: a
 *     second keymap is the exact "second grammar" failure this codebase exists to
 *     prevent. The one thing the showcase does NOT inherit is `screenForHotkey`,
 *     whose letters belong to the real nav — `g` + a showcase letter jumps to a
 *     showcase section, and anything else is a no-op rather than a jump onto a real
 *     screen the showcase cannot draw.
 *   - `topbar` / `chipFor` / `progressLineFor` for the topbar, so the range control
 *     and the live chip are the panel's own, over a fabricated sync state.
 *   - `framePolicy` for the width decision, `bodyRows` for the frame budget, and
 *     `footerHints`/`hintsFor` for the hint row — none of them re-derived here.
 *   - `rangeHit` for the topbar's segment hit areas, and `MouseFrame` for the frame
 *     arithmetic — both from `mouse.ts`.
 *
 * WHAT IS FORKED, and reported as a grammar gap rather than worked around:
 * `sidebar()` and `buildTabs()` are closed over the real screen registry
 * (chrome-critique's answer), so the nav lives in `showcase/nav.ts` — painted with
 * `SIDEBAR_INK` and `tabs.ts`'s own `TabBarTheme`, so the ink ladder is still the
 * single tested one. The missing seams are
 * `sidebar(theme, preset, groups, activeId, hoveredId?)` and
 * `hitTest(frame, row, col, sidebarHit)`.
 *
 * NO DATABASE, EVER. The data is `showcaseData(sectionId)`, a fixture, resolved
 * synchronously. `test/showcase-panel.test.ts` asserts at the source level that no
 * module under `showcase/` names `bun:sqlite`, `initDb`, `fetchFor` or
 * `startIngest`, because a future edit reaching for the DB would pass every other
 * test here and only fail in someone's real session, ~850 ms later, on the
 * keystroke they just typed.
