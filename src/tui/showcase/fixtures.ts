/**
 * `src/tui/showcase/fixtures.ts` — fabricated payloads for `/stats-test`.
 *
 * THE ONE FILE THAT IS ALLOWED TO LIE. Every real screen is bound to
 * `~/.omp/stats.db`; this one is bound to nothing, deliberately, because its job
 * is to be a design playground and a capability probe of what `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui`
 * can actually draw. A figure here is a test vector, not a claim about anyone's
 * usage, and nothing in this file is ever shown to a user as a fact.
 *
 * WHY FABRICATED SHAPES RATHER THAN A RECORDED ONES. The showcase has to survive
 * changes to the host's own types: a recorded payload from `/api/stats/overview`
 * would be frozen at eight top-level keys, and when the route gained a ninth the
 * playground would keep rendering the old shape without complaint. Declaring the
 * shapes here means the compiler fails when the host moves, which is the only
 * mechanism in this codebase that can do that. The real fixture
 * (`test/fixtures/panel.ts`) still exists and still pins route-shaped data for
 * the real screens; the showcase is deliberately a DIFFERENT exercise.
 *
 * THE AWKWARD VALUES, and why each one earns its place. Every case here is a
 * place the grammar has a decision to make, and a fixture that stops being
 * awkward stops testing the decision it exists to test:
 *
 *   - {@link AWKWARD_LABEL}, 40 cells. The stat grid measures tiles from the
 *     widest label and clamps the tile at `TILE_MAX_WIDTH` (34), so a 40-cell
 *     label is past the ceiling: the VALUE truncates and the label does not.
 *   - {@link AWKWARD_COST}, which renders 25 characters — past `VALUE_WIDTH` (12)
 *     and past every column the grammar keeps, so it lands on the truncation
 *     policy's step 3, the one place a `…` is allowed.
 *   - {@link ZERO_MODEL}, a measured zero. A zero spend must read differently
 *     from an absent one, and only a fixture that carries one can prove it.
 *   - Negative `cacheSavings`, because that figure is a dollar-savings RATIO and
 *     goes negative whenever cache writes cost more than cache reads save.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and why:
 *
 *   - No database. The showcase never imports `bun:sqlite`, `initDb`,
 *     `fetchFor` or `startIngest`; `test/showcase-panel.test.ts` asserts that at
 *     the source level, because a future edit reaching for the DB would pass
 *     every other test and only fail in someone's real session.
 *   - No `theme`. Colour arrives injected, through the panel's own theme object.
 *   - No clock. {@link SHOWCASE_NOW} is fixed, because `renderScreen` derives its
 *     bucket axis from an injected clock and a wall-clock fixture would place its
 *     buckets outside that axis whenever the suite ran on a different day — the
 *     charts would legitimately draw nothing and the failure would look like a
 *     chart bug.

 * grammar keeps, so it exercises the truncation policy's last step: the one place
 * a `…` may appear, and only at the end of a real number rather than as a cell of
 * its own.
 *
 * TWO NOTES ON THE BRIEF'S "20-DIGIT NUMBER", both of which changed this fixture.
 *
 * 1. `formatCost` can never render EXACTLY 20 characters. Its comma grouping
 *    yields 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 … at successive magnitudes and skips 20 entirely,
 *    so a figure pinned to a 20-character render does not exist. The awkward
 *    figure is therefore pinned by its RENDERED LENGTH (23) — the property the
 *    truncation policy actually cares about — and 23 tests it harder than 20
 *    would have.
 *
 * 2. A literal 20-digit `totalCost` is not usable either: at that magnitude a JS
 *    double cannot hold the cents, so the value arriving at the formatter is
 *    already rounded (987654321012345678.9 becomes …700) and the fixture would be
 *    testing float precision rather than layout. This value has 15 significant
 *    digits before the point and survives the round trip exactly, which is what
 *    lets the test assert on the digits AND the rendered width honestly.
