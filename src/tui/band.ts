/**
 * The band grammar — the single place a screen body is composed.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS FIXES. The panel read as a stack of text blocks with a
 * `───` rule above every section, which is what a terminal looks like when each
 * screen invented its own structure. `/usage` draws ZERO rules inside its body.
 * F21 found exactly four band shapes in the web dashboard; F23 turned them into
 * six invariants (G1–G6) that a renderer can follow without making a layout
 * decision. This module IS that renderer.
 *
 * ── The invariants, and why each exists ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **G1 — a band is a heading line plus body lines.** The heading is omitted for
 * `statRow` and `note` (G3) and present for `chart`, `table`.
 *
 * **G2 — the heading is** `` `${icon} ${boldAccent(title)}` `` with, when meta
 * exists, `  ${dim(meta)}` appended on THE SAME LINE. Never a rule.
 *
 * **G3 — `statRow` and `note` have no heading and no icon.** They are the page's
 * first line and its inline caveat, mirroring F21's `StatGrid` sitting directly
 * under `PageHeader` and the web's prose caveats (`CostsRoute.tsx:77`).
 *
 * **G4 — exactly one blank line between consecutive bands.** No leading blank,
 * no trailing blank, no doubles. A band that renders nothing contributes
 * nothing and leaves no gap.
 *
 * **G5 — NO BAND BODY MAY EMIT A FULL-WIDTH RULE.** This is the invariant that
 * kills the complaint, and the reason this module exists at all. `─`, `━` or `═`
 * inside a band is a bug, full stop. F23 §2.2: "This is the single invariant
 * that kills the complaint." Do NOT reintroduce a rule as a section separator —
 * that is the exact regression being fixed. `test/band.test.ts` asserts it
 * literally against a rule-character pattern for every band kind and every
 * preset, so a rule cannot come back quietly.
 *
 * **G6 — the only rule in the whole panel is the `PanelDivider` between body and
 * footer**, exactly as `usage-dashboard.ts:573` has exactly one.
 *
 * `legend` is the deliberate exception to G4: in the web a legend lives INSIDE
 * the chart card, directly beneath it (`OverviewRoute.tsx:181-244`). So it is a
 * continuation — no heading, no blank line before, one after.
 *
 * ── Why `bands` is a parameter and not part of `ScreenContext` ──────────────
 * F23's seam is deliberate. Putting presentation on the data contract would let
 * any screen bypass the grammar by returning pre-rendered lines — which is the
 * exact failure being fixed. `ScreenContext` is deliberately NOT extended; bands
 * are passed in beside it.
 *
 * ── Why the types below are declared here and not imported ─────────────────
 * `src/layout/spec.ts` is owned by another agent and is in flux, so importing
 * from it would make this file's compilation depend on their schedule. The
 * shapes below are MINIMAL STRUCTURAL mirrors of the IR's union: same fields,
 * same discriminants, no extra constraint, so they are assignable in both
 * directions and the two definitions can be reconciled without churn.

// ─── Per-kind layout, as F23 §2.3 determines it ──────────────────────────────

/**
 * `statRow` — a compact grid of tiles, each tile STACKED.
 *
 * The LAYOUT WITHIN a tile is the web's `Stat`: label above, value below, hint
 * under that (`Stat.tsx`: `.stat-label`, `.stat-value`, `.stat-foot`). That
 * fixes three things at once:
 *
 *  1. **A label never touches its value**, because they are on different rows.
 *     No pad width can promise that — `LABEL_WIDTH` is 12 and
 *     "API-equivalent cost" is 18.
 *  2. **One value per tile.** The hint used to be appended INLINE, so a tile
 *     read `Requests 65,460 1,315`: two figures in one cell and nothing in the
 *     layout to say which was the measurement.
 *  3. **Room for a sparkline** under the tile when the grid is one or two
 *     columns wide (F23 §2.3).
 *
 * The GEOMETRY BETWEEN tiles is measured, not divided. That is the fix for the
 * reported defect, and the reasoning is in `tileWidthOf`: dividing the panel
 * between slots left 48-cell tiles holding 13-cell figures, and the rounding
 * made the row overflow so `clamp` printed a bare `…` off the right of every
 * line. Measuring makes the grid exactly as wide as its widest tile, so it can
 * never overflow and never needs clamping.
 *
 * The F23 rules that survive unchanged, and are still load-bearing:
 *   - a hint is DROPPED rather than truncated ("a half-printed `34,870 unpr` is
 *     a worse claim than no hint", F23 §2.3 rule 2);
 *   - the VALUE is truncated and the LABEL never is ("a truncated label is
 *     still a label", F23 §2.3 rule 3);
 *   - `emphasis: "primary"` is bold + accent, the web's larger first tile.
