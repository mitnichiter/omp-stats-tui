/**
 * `src/tui/responsive.ts` — the responsive FRAME policy: which band a total
 * width lands in and what chrome that band gets.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. `layout.ts` already owns the width table
 * (`BREAKPOINTS`, keyed by inner width) and the geometry (`planLayout`); the
 * panel already recomputes that table on EVERY render from the current width
 * and clamps scroll inside `render`, so shrink-on-resize is automatic. What no
 * module stated is the FRAME contract the chrome builds against: at this total
 * width, is the sidebar full/icons/hidden, is the topbar full/condensed/
 * minimal. That mapping lives here, DERIVED from the table rather than
 * restated beside it — a retuned threshold flows through with no edit here,
 * which a second table would not.
 *
 * BANDS (totals = inner + the overlay's 4 insets; edges fall out of the table,
 * never restated):
 *
 * | band   | total     | inner  | chrome                        | intent                              |
 * |--------|-----------|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 * | wide   | ≥ 84      | ≥ 80   | sidebar full, topbar full     | two columns, 4 table cols           |
 * | medium | 48–83     | 44–79  | sidebar icons, topbar condensed | one column, 3 table cols (web 1100px: grids → 1fr) |
 * | narrow | 34–47     | 30–43  | sidebar hidden, topbar condensed | 2 table cols, footer drops from right (web LiveChip hides) |
 * | tiny   | < 34      | < 30   | sidebar hidden, topbar minimal | footer hints off, body-first (web 900px: drawer + hamburger) |
 *
 * The ORDER mirrors the web's CSS (`styles.css`: 1360px sidebar narrows,
 * 1100px grids collapse, 900px drawer + `topbar-hide-narrow`), not its px
 * values — px have no terminal meaning. The 80/44/30 inner thresholds are
 * content minima: 80 holds two legible columns (total-80 ⇒ inner-76, so a
 * `>= 76` rule would tear the most common terminal); 44 holds three table
 * columns; 30 holds two plus a hint row beside content.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO. No geometry (that is `planLayout`), no tab
 * measuring (that is `TAB_ROWS` in `frame.ts` — the strip wraps below ~58
 * columns and the cost is a measured body row, never a breakpoint), no scroll
 * state (the panel clamps inside `render`, following `usage-dashboard.ts:903-905`,
 * never in the key handler), no line cache (the panel holds none; if one is
 * ever added its key MUST include width AND data generation, per
 * `usage-dashboard.ts:887`). PURE: no theme, no terminal, no data.
