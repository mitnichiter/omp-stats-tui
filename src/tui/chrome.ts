/**
 * Web-shell chrome port: sidebar nav, topbar, live chip, progress line.
 *
 * Source of truth is the omp-stats web Shell (read-only host files, never
 * modified): `app/Shell.tsx` (topbar + sidebar + progress three-state),
 * `app/nav.ts` (NAV groups, hotkeys), `app/LiveChip.tsx` (chip branch order),
 * `client/data/range.ts` (TIME_RANGES order). Deviations from the web are
 * marked OURS with reasoning; everything else cites the web line it mirrors.
 *
 * KEYMAP DECISION (stated once, see also test/chrome.test.ts header):
 * digits (`1`-`9`/`0`) and `g`-letters are ALIASES for the same target
 * (screen). The web's digits-as-range half is deliberately NOT mirrored:
 * our digits already select screens and a digit cannot pick both a range and
 * a screen. Range stays on `r`/`R` — and now also on `←`/`→`, which are
 * aliases for the same range step rather than a second way to change screens
 * (see panel.ts, which owns the keymap). While the `g` prefix is armed the
 * next letter is consumed even on no match (web parity); a stale prefix
 * (>1200 ms) falls through (web parity: timestamp check, no timer).
 *
 * TOPBAR GEOMETRY, decided once and cited above `topbar()`: the wordmark and
 * the action cluster are TWO regions separated by a painted spacer, because
 * the web separates them with `flex: 1` (styles.css:453-455) rather than with
 * a gap. The chip is an enclosed surface (`.live-chip`'s fill, styles.css:1597)
 * and the range control is one container with a single thumb
 * (`.segmented`, styles.css:1056-1080).
 *
 * MODES come from `framePolicy` (responsive.ts), never a local width table:
 * wide shows the full grouped sidebar + full topbar, medium/narrow show the
 * icon rail + condensed topbar (chip dropped, mirroring `topbar-hide-narrow`),
 * tiny hides the sidebar and keeps brand + active range. The panel additionally
 * degrades full → rail → hidden on SHORT terminals so the frame never exceeds
 * the terminal height; that call lives in panel.ts, not here.
 *
 * PURE. Theme and preset arrive as arguments; the module holds no singleton
 * (the `theme` binding is undefined until init) and reads no terminal or data.

/**
 * THE FULL GROUPED SIDEBAR, ALIGNED AS A COLUMN.
 *
 * `.nav-row` in the web is a flex row: icon, `.nav-row-label { flex: 1 }`, then
 * `kbd` (styles.css:522-574, Shell.tsx:106-108). The label's `flex: 1` is the
 * load-bearing part — it eats all free width, so the jump hint is pushed to the
 * row's TRAILING EDGE and the eight hints form a right-hand column instead of
 * a ragged staircase hanging off eight different label lengths.
 *
 * Ours appended `G <letter>` immediately after the label, so every row's hint
 * started at a different column and the block read as prose. That is defect 4.
 * The port reproduces the geometry with three measured columns:
 *
 *   [2-cell prefix slot] [icon gutter] [label column] [gap] [jump key]
 *
 * ICON GUTTER is measured from the icons this nav actually draws rather than
 * read from `ICON_GUTTER`, because the host registry (`theme.symbol("icon.*")`)
 * returns whatever the active preset binds and that is not always the table
 * entry — `icons.ts` is explicit that the two can disagree.
 *
 * THE LADDER, AND WHERE IT CAME FROM. Every ink below is a NAMED level from
 * `SIDEBAR_INK` rather than a token chosen here, because choosing at the call
 * site is how the three headings ended up the same colour: there was no list to
 * choose FROM. The ladder is `--ink-4` (jump hint) → `--ink-3` (heading, row
 * icon) → `--ink-2` (row label) → `--ink-1` (selected), with `--accent` on the
 * active row's ICON — which is exactly the web's own set: `.nav-heading` ink-3
 * (styles.css:515-520), `.nav-row svg` ink-3 (:552-555), `.nav-row` ink-2
 * (:522-536), `.nav-row:hover` and `[data-active]` ink-1 (:538-541, :547-550),
 * `.nav-row[data-active] svg` `--accent` (:557-559), `.nav-row kbd` ink-4
 * (:565-570). `test/palette.test.ts` pins the ORDER against a real theme,
 * because two levels one step apart that happen to resolve to the same hex is
 * the failure mode a token list hides.
 *
 * THE ACTIVE ROW IS A FILLED ROW. `.nav-row[data-active="true"]` is
 * `background: var(--selected); color: var(--ink-1)` (styles.css:547-550) —
 * the web fills the selected nav row and keeps its label at ink-1. Ours painted
 * accent TEXT on no fill, which is why the nav read as a list of coloured words
 * and not as a control with a position in it. The 2-cell cursor prefix stays
 * (settings-list.ts:939-940): the web separates the two states with background
 * ALPHA, which a terminal cannot render, so it needs a cue that survives a
 * monochrome theme.
 *
 * HOVER AND ACTIVE SHARE THE BAND AND THE INK, AND THAT IS FAITHFUL. The web
 * separates them by background alpha alone — `--hover` at 0.035 against
 * `--selected` at 0.075 (styles.css:17, :19) — over the same `--ink-1` label.
 * A terminal has one background token and no alpha, so the terminal has to
 * spend the distinction somewhere else, and the three cues it uses are the ones
 * the web already has: the ACCENT ICON, the cursor, and weight. All three are
 * absent from a hover row (settings-list.ts:778, 792-796), so hover can never
 * be mistaken for the keyboard position.
 *
 * THE ACCENT IS SPENT ONCE, ON THE ICON. css-tokens.md:104 restricts `--accent`
 * to "the active sidebar item's icon" and the value flash, and the CSS agrees: the
 * active row's `color` is ink-1 and only its `svg` takes the accent
 * (styles.css:557-559). The group headings do NOT wear it, and that is the
 * whole of the reported complaint — when the active heading wore the same hue
 * as the active row, the heading and the selection were one colour and the
 * group structure disappeared into it. The active heading steps up to ink-1
 * instead, which is the web's own selection rule applied to the structure that
 * contains the selection.
 *
 * Off-section ROWS stay at ink-2 rather than being dimmed. The host dims
 * off-section rows in a split pane where rows stay selectable; here a dimmed
 * row reads as DISABLED, and the group cue lives in the heading where it can be
 * read without disabling anything.

 * THE TOPBAR IS THREE REGIONS, NOT ONE SENTENCE.

 * [actions]`, where the spacer is `.topbar-spacer { flex: 1 }`
 * (styles.css:453-455) and `.topbar-actions` holds the LiveChip, the
 * `Segmented` range control and the ThemeToggle (Shell.tsx:74-80). The
 * separation between the wordmark and the controls is therefore NOT a gap
 * value — it is every cell the browser has left over, and on a 1440px viewport
 * that is roughly 850px against 8px between the chip and the control
 * (styles.css:460).
 *
 * A terminal has no viewport and therefore no `flex: 1`. The separation has to
 * be PAINTED, and that is the whole fix for "the chip sits jammed next to
 * `omp/stats` and reads as part of the wordmark": the brand is laid down at
 * column 0 and the action cluster is laid down at the right edge, so the cells
 * between them are the port of the spacer.
 *
 * TWO ENCLOSURES, NOT TWO SENTENCES. The scout read off the web's own rule for
 * what makes a control read as a control: `.live-chip` is a filled, bordered,
 * full-pill-radius box (styles.css:1595-1597) and `.segmented` is a filled,
 * bordered box (styles.css:1063), while `.topbar-brand` is naked text
 * with no enclosure at all. The terminal has no border-radius, so the faithful
 * form of "this is a surface" is a BACKGROUND. Hence: the chip gets
 * `selectedBg`, and the range control's active segment gets the host TabBar's
 * `activeTab` pill (chrome/shared.ts:21). Two enclosed objects, brand naked —
 * the same three-way read the web gets.
 *
 * THE RANGE CONTROL IS ONE CONTROL. `.segmented` is a single container with
 * `gap: 0` (styles.css:1061) holding six flush options and one absolutely
 * positioned thumb (styles.css:1068-1080, positioned from `Segmented.tsx:26-44`).
 * The terminal port keeps the two things that survive without geometry: a
 * uniform inactive style on every segment (`inactiveTab`, chrome/shared.ts:22)
 * and exactly one `activeTab` pill, with the segments packed flush so the run
 * reads as one object. `gap: 0` is why the join is `""` and not `" "`: the
 * segment's own single-cell padding IS the gutter, exactly as the web's 10px
 * option padding is.
 *
 * ORDER OF SACRIFICE is fixed, not incidental: freshness, then the chip, then
 * the segment run, then the segment run collapses to its active member. The
 * chip goes first of the controls because the web wraps exactly it in
 * `.topbar-hide-narrow` (Shell.tsx:75-77, styles.css:655-657) while the range
 * control always survives — the range IS the window you are looking at.
