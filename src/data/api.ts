/**
 * THE DATA SEAM.
 *
 * `handleApi` is a plain `async (req: Request) => Promise<Response>` exported
 * from `@oh-my-pi/omp-stats/server`. Its body reads the request only through
 * `new URL(req.url)`, `req.method`, `req.headers.get(...)` and
 * `url.searchParams` — never `req.json()`, `req.body` or `req.signal` — and it
 * contains zero references to the Bun server object. The only `server.*` call in
 * that file lives in `createDashboardServer`'s SSE branch, outside `handleApi`.
 *
 * So `new Request("http://localhost/api/stats/overview")` is a complete input.
 * NO SOCKET IS BOUND AND NO SERVER IS STARTED: the host part of the URL is a
 * formality that makes the string a valid absolute URL, and nothing dials it.
 * Calling it in-process is what lets all the read routes run inside the panel
 * instead of behind a local webserver.
 */

 * The reader is injected in tests to serve fixtures, so it may hand back either

 * branch is where a non-OK status becomes an error, and a fixture reader that
 * skips it would let a 404 parse into a body that renders as zeroes.
