/**
 * Four defects found by LOOKING at the rendered output, not by reading it.
 *
 * Every assertion here corresponds to a line a human read off the probe and
 * said "that is wrong". They live in their own file because they share one
 * subject — the shapes a stat tile, a bar chart and a legend take — and because
 * each has a specific, nameable cause:
 *
 *   D1  A tile's label and value are jammed together (`API-equivalent cost$112.36`).
 *       The web's `Stat` puts the label on its OWN LINE above the value.
 *   D2  A tile appears to carry TWO values (`Requests 65,460 1,315`). It is
 *       really the hint running on beside the value, but a reader cannot tell.
 *   D3  A multi-series time chart draws N identical blocks with no label, so it
 *       reads as one line repeated rather than as two series.
 *   D4  A legend swatch is TWO glyphs, and the legend's percentage disagrees with
 *       the share bar directly above it for the same quantity.
 *
 * D4 is the one that matters most: two computations of one number is exactly
 * how a dashboard starts disagreeing with itself, and the web draws both from
 * the same `mix[key] / total`.
