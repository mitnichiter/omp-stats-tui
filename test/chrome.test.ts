/**
 * Web-shell chrome port: sidebar nav, topbar, live chip, progress line.
 *
 * Source of truth is the omp-stats web Shell (read-only host files, never
 * modified): `app/Shell.tsx` (topbar + sidebar + progress three-state),
 * `app/nav.ts` (NAV groups, hotkeys), `app/LiveChip.tsx` (chip branch order),
 * `client/data/range.ts` (TIME_RANGES order). Every behavior below cites the
 * web line it mirrors; deviations are marked OURS with reasoning.
 *
 * KEYMAP DECISION (the brief asks for it stated once):
 * - Web binds `1`-`6` to RANGES and `g then letter` to sections (Shell.tsx
 *   useShortcuts). We mirror `g then letter` for screens, but we do NOT mirror
 *   digits-as-range: our digits already select screens (`1`-`9`/`0`, enforced by
 *   the number-row block at the end of this file), and a digit cannot pick both
 *   a range and a screen. Range stays on `r`/`R` cycle.
 * - So digits and `g`-letters are ALIASES for the same target (screen): `1`
 *   and `g o` both land on overview. No collision is possible because the two
 *   sequences share no prefix key: digits act immediately, letters act only
 *   while a `g` prefix is armed (1200 ms window, Shell.tsx parity).
 * - Consequence, mirrored exactly from the web: while the prefix is armed the
 *   next letter is CONSUMED even on no match — so `g r` jumps to requests and
 *   never cycles the range, `g s` does not start a sync, `g 1` does nothing.
 *   A stale prefix (>1200 ms) falls through to the normal keymap, exactly as
 *   the web's timestamp check does (no timer, no visual indicator, same as web).
 * - Hotkeys are the web's verbatim (nav.ts) except `activity`, which has no web
 *   section (OURS: `a`). `NAV_GROUPS` keeps a row only when `specForScreen` and
 *   `isDrawableScreen` agree there is a body to draw, so a deferred or
 *   spec-less screen gets neither a sidebar row nor a letter — a jump that
 *   paints a page the panel cannot honestly fill wastes the keystroke. Today
 *   every entry of `SELECTABLE_SCREENS` clears that filter, so all twelve have
 *   a row and a letter; `traces` and `frustration` (`g t`, `g f`) are the two
 *   screens PAST THE NUMBER ROW, not jump exceptions.
