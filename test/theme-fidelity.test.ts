/**
 * Theme fidelity: every colour the panel paints comes from an omp theme token,
 * and every one of those tokens is a NAMED role in `src/tui/palette.ts`.
 *
 * This file restores the two structural guards the pre-merge base carried in
 * `test/render-screen.test.ts` — "every colour role the renderer emits is one
 * `PALETTE` names" and "the renderer imports no theme VALUE and no dynamic
 * module load" — and EXTENDS them from the single renderer file to every module
 * under `src/`. The base could scope itself to one file because that file was
 * the only renderer. After the merge it is not: `src/tui/features/**` is ~2,800
 * lines of hand-rolled rendering, and no test looked at it.
 *
 * Why these are STRUCTURAL assertions and not behavioural ones: every one of
 * them catches a defect that renders perfectly in the test that triggers it. A
 * hand-written `#0088fa` restyles fine until the user switches theme. A module
 * scope `theme.fg(...)` reads `undefined` before init and takes the extension
 * loader down at import, which no fixture can reproduce because the fixtures
 * initialise the theme first. A dynamic `import("@oh-my-pi/…")` works under
 * `bun test` and fails in the loader, because the loader's resolve hook
 * rewrites static specifiers only. Each of those is invisible to every other
 * test in this suite, which is precisely why they need one.
 *
 * The standing rule, from AGENTS.md §Code Conventions: "Do not hardcode colours
 * or heading glyphs. Use active omp theme roles via `src/tui/palette.ts`
 * (`PALETTE`/`SERIES_COLORS`, resolved for the current theme)." And §Runtime &
 * Tooling Constraints: "Do not read the host `theme` eagerly at module scope" /
 * "Do not use dynamic `import()` of `@oh-my-pi/*`."
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not repair what it finds.
 * A guard that fires forty times and gets edited until it fires zero times has
 * stopped guarding. The offenders are named, counted and reported; the owner
 * decides.
