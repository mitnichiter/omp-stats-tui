/**
 * `test/redundant-layout.test.ts` — three redundancies a rendered screen shows.
 *
 * Every test here was written by LOOKING at `bun scripts/probe-render.ts costs
 * --width 150` and finding something repeated rather than by reading a spec and
 * imagining a defect. Each rule is stated once, asserted through the REAL
 * renderer over a synthetic `ScreenSpec`, and — where the shipped specs are the
 * case that produced the screenshot — over the shipped spec as well.
 *
 *   A  A `legend` band whose every item the chart above already PUBLISHED on its
 *      own rows is a second rendering of that chart, and is dropped.
 *   B  A table column that resolves to zero in EVERY row carries no variation and
 *      is dropped — except the money-caveat column, which AGENTS.md:228 requires
 *      beside cost always.
 *   C  A stat tile's HINT that resolves to zero, and restates a figure a sibling
 *      tile in the same statRow already states, is dropped.
 *
 * None of the three is "delete the feature". A legend stays for a chart that
 * cannot name its own series; the caveat column stays; a non-zero hint stays, and
 * so does a zero hint that is the only place its figure appears. Each of those
 * has its own test below, because a rule stated only by its exception is a rule
 * nobody can check.
