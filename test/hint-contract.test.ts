/**
 * `test/hint-contract.test.ts` — the THREE hint shapes, and the guard that
 * distinguishes them.
 *
 * A stat tile's `hint` is three different things and the IR has to say which:
 *
 *   - a `MetricRef` — a SECOND FIGURE, read against the payload and formatted by
 *     its own field's formatter;
 *   - a `string` — PROSE, printed verbatim;
 *   - `{ text: string }` — that same prose, spelled as an object.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The IR originally admitted only the first and third, so a
 * spec author writing `hint: "a caveat in prose"` — the obvious reading — was not
 * wrong, and nothing said so until RENDER time: the consumer's `"text" in hint`
 * threw a `TypeError`, because `in` requires an object on its right. The failure
 * appeared in someone's session, inside one tile, rather than at compile time.
 *
 * So the type now admits all three, and {@link isProseHint} /
 * {@link proseHintText} are the one narrowing rule. These tests pin the RULES, not
 * the current call sites: a consumer that re-invents its own `in` check is exactly
 * the bug this contract exists to prevent, and a test that only asserted "a string
 * hint does not throw" would be satisfied by the type alone while leaving both
 * prose-rendering paths unproven.
