/**
 * `test/screens.test.ts` — ONE screen list, and the test that says so.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PINS. Two modules used to answer "is this a screen?" from the
 * same two inputs — the `SCREENS` registry and the `SCREEN_SPECS` table — with
 * two different rules:
 *
 *   - `panel.ts`'s `SELECTABLE_SCREENS` filtered the registry to ids with a
 *     non-`deferred` spec;
 *   - `chrome.ts`'s `NAV_GROUPS` filtered a hand-written group map to ids with a
 *     spec AND a jump hotkey.
 *
 * Nothing connected them. Each was internally consistent, so the failure mode was
 * silent and asymmetric: a screen could become arrow-selectable while vanishing
 * from the sidebar, or appear in the nav with no body to draw, and every test in
 * the suite would still pass because each module was only ever compared with
 * itself. That is the class of duplication that let a real bug survive several
 * passes here.
 *
 * Both now derive from {@link isDrawableScreen}. These tests are the reason that
 * stays true.

/**
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE BEHAVIOURAL ONES ABOVE.
 *
 * Every behavioural assertion here was checked against a mutation that
 * re-introduces the duplication — replacing `NAV_GROUPS`' call to
 * `isDrawableScreen` with its own private `spec && !spec.deferred` rule — and ALL
 * FOURTEEN STILL PASSED. That is not a gap in those tests; it is the reason this
 * one exists.
 *
 * The two rules are currently EQUIVALENT, so a duplicated rule is behaviourally
 * INVISIBLE: it cannot be found by comparing outputs, because the outputs are
 * identical. Every behavioural test for "these cannot drift" is therefore vacuous
 * until the rules actually diverge — which is exactly the moment nobody is
 * watching.
 *
 * So the invariant is asserted where the duplication actually lives: the SOURCE.
 * Both modules must obtain "drawable" from the one predicate and neither may
 * re-state the rule. That is a fact about the code rather than about one run of
 * it, and it holds before the rules diverge as well as after.
