/**
 * A SCREEN REACHABLE BY ARROW KEY MUST BE VISIBLE IN THE FRAME YOU REACH IT FROM.
 *
 * Reported: pressing `←`/`→` makes the sidebar visibly jump. Two separate causes,
 * found by diffing all ten screens' sidebar columns at widths 100/150 and
 * heights 19-40, and both fixed here.
 *
 * D1 THE NAV WAS TRUNCATED BY THE BODY. `#zipSidebar` mapped over the body's
 * visible rows, so the nav column was exactly as tall as the body happened to be.
 * `overview` has a 50-line body against `gain`'s 12, and `gain` is the LAST nav
 * row — so arrowing from overview to gain dropped the entire active marker. The
 * nav appeared to jump to a screen it never drew. `panel.ts:#zipSidebar` now
 * takes `max(body rows, nav lines)` and pads the body, never the nav.
 *
 * D2 TWO SCREENS HAD NO NAV ROW AT ALL. `providers` and `gain` are on the
 * `←`/`→` cycle but had no HOTKEYS entry, and `NAV_GROUPS` drops ids without one,
 * so arrowing onto them removed the `❯` outright and left every group heading on
 * its inactive ink. Both are now in the nav.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE between two screens: the `❯` marker, and the active
 * group's heading ink. Nothing else — not row order, not row text, not the nav's
 * height, not the column width.
