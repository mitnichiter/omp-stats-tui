/**
 * `test/showcase-grammar.test.ts` — the showcase proves the grammar, so this
 * test holds it to that.
 *
 * A playground that quietly omits a case is worse than no playground: it looks
 * comprehensive and is not, and the omission is invisible in a screenshot. So
 * coverage is asserted structurally, against the declared specs, rather than by
 * reading the rendered output and hoping.
 *
 * The obligations, one per grammar surface:
 *
 *   - every `Band` kind the IR declares appears in some showcase section;
 *   - every `ChartSpec.type` appears — the five chart primitives;
 *   - single-series AND multi-series bars both appear, because `compose.ts` is
 *     only meaningful beside the primitive it composes;
 *   - every `ChartSpec.axis` appears, because the axis decides the heading meta
 *     and the figure printed beside the bar;
 *   - every `Column.cell` kind appears — text, meter, badge, sparkline;
 *   - at least two column-priority tiers, so the drop order is demonstrated
 *     rather than described in a comment;
 *   - `emphasis: "primary"` and plain tiles both appear;
 *   - every section renders at every width on every preset, within width, with no
 *     rule anywhere (G5).
 *
 * WHAT THE SHOWCASE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DEMONSTRATE, per the owners of the
 * modules involved, so these are pinned here rather than re-litigated later:
 *
 *   - `StatTile.size` ("sm" | "md") is dead by design (chart-redraw): the panel
 *     picks tile columns from width, so a second size axis with no terminal effect
 *     would be a lie in the IR. The showcase varies `emphasis` only.
 *   - A WRAPPED table cell is out of the grammar by design (chart-redraw):
 *     wrapping breaks one-row-per-record, which every row-count invariant
 *     downstream depends on. The showcase shows TRUNCATION and labels it as such.
 *   - The `custom` band is unreachable through `renderScreen` (`toBand` turns
 *     every custom band into a NOTE) and is being retired. A showcase that used
 *     it would be demonstrating the grammar's bypass, not the grammar.
